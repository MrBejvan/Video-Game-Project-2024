# Video Game Project 2024
 Simple Video Game Project

Data Structure Implemented: Sorted Circular Linked List
Additional Structure Implemented: Map

Project Overview: This project began as a personal project a few weeks before the project proposal was due because I wanted a relatable but challenging programming problem to work on that could be used as the base for my Data Structures project. It was quite challenging to learn a new language just for this project, but the format of a game was easily understandable to me. I created all of the art and scripting for the current implementation of this project with the help and inspiration from several YouTube channels that I will list below. Additionally, Reddit forums for GODOT as well as StackOverflow were incredibly helpful at my most challenging points. Personally, the biggest challenge for this project was to build it in such a way that code could be re-used easily and specific data could be accessed through resource files instead of directly built in scripts, which would have taken so much longer to create. Getting all of the files to correctly communicate with each other was a really amazing challenge and I spent lots of time just trying to figure that out. But once I had that sorted out, I was able to implement my turnTracker and sceneNavigation features very easily and I have a stable skeleton for scripting that I can copy-paste to other parts of my game.

The data structure that I implemented is a single-link, sorted, circular linked list. The function of this data structure is to operate as a turn tracker for a simple video game. GDscript is actually a pointerless language, similar to Python, so to build the data structure I had to simply create a new CharacterNode Class with properties that included a 'nextUp' value where I stored the next CharacterNode. Practically, this data structure was built in such a way as to dynamically collect Character nodes and their relevant ability scores, sort the characters based on those scores, and then return a re-linked circular list. Currently, there are no mechanics for when a character reaches 0 HP and should be removed from the linked list, but this should be easily implemented with the use of signals which would trigger a function for the list to relink itself in sorted order with all remaining characters with HP > 0.

The sorting algorithm for the circular linked list is very simple; using each character's swift ability score it places the highest value as the head of the list followed by the character node with the next highest value, the head of the linked list's 'nextUp' property is set to that character node, and the process is repeated until the 'head' is reached again. For tie-breakers the current implementation simply sets the character node first encountered during sorting ahead of the other characters with the same score. Future implementation will involve taking all of the character nodes with the same 'swift' score and assigning each of them a random integer between 1 and 20, then assigning them to the turnTracker in that order.

The additional data structure that was implemented was a map/associative array. This is actually a built-in feature of the game engine, but I used it to great effect for scene navigation from the WorldMap scene. I built a dictionary with key value pairs, where the keys were simple scene titles and the values were the file path addresses. This allowed me to compartmentalize the sceneDirectory and keep it separate from the rest of the scripting while also letting me grab the path values from simple keys that were set into 2d Collision Shapes on my WorldMap. When the player icon collided with these collision shapes, a signal containing the key would be sent to the WorldMap script which would then translate the value pair. Once translated, this path value would then be used to update a button, which upon being pressed, would execute a scene transition to that particular level. I am not sure if this is exactly mentioning since it was a built-in feature and I did not really modify it from what we practiced in class. However, getting many different file paths setup to work properly based on their keys in my game was very challenging and I consider what I learned extremely valuable, not only in terms of building a functional program, but also in terms of organizing a project and all of its subsequent parts.
