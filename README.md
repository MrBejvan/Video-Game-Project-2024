Quick note on video presentation and a thank you - This video is very in depth and I apologize for the long format. I have edited as best as I could, but there is just a ton of content that I wanted to cover for this project. If desired or necessary I could re-record this in a more condensed format. Please reach out via email if this is requested, and thank you for the opportunity to learn in your classroom.

Project Overview: This project began as a personal project a few weeks before the project proposal was due because I wanted a relatable but challenging programming problem to work on that could be used as the base for my Data Structures project. It was quite challenging to learn a new language just for this project, but the format of a game was easily understandable to me and helped facilitate the learning process. I created all of the art and scripting for the current implementation of this project with the help and inspiration from several YouTube channels that I will list below. Additionally, Reddit forums for GODOT, as well as StackOverflow, were incredibly helpful at my most challenging points. Personally, the biggest challenge for this project was to build it in such a way that code could be re-used easily and specific data could be accessed through resource files instead of directly built-in scripts, which would have taken so much longer to create. Getting all of the files to correctly communicate with each other was an amazing challenge and I spent much of my time just trying to figure that out. But once I had it set up correctly, I was able to implement my turnTracker and sceneNavigation features very easily and I have a stable skeleton for scripting that I can copy-paste to other parts of my game.

The main data structure that I implemented is a single-link, sorted, circular linked list. The function of this data structure is to operate as a turn tracker for a simple video game. GDscript is a pointerless language, similar to Python, so to build the data structure I had to create a Class called CharacterNode with properties that included a 'nextUp' value where I stored the next CharacterNode. This functioned as the link between nodes in the list. Practically, this data structure was built in such a way as to dynamically collect character nodes and their relevant ability scores, sort the characters based on those scores, and then return a re-linked circular list. Currently, there are no mechanics for updating a character's health bar, which will ultimately trigger a 'death' mechanic and the subsequent removal of the character from the circular linked list. However, I built a 'killButton' which is designed to randomly remove a character from the linked list via a random integer generated and modified with the modulo operator. This was built to demonstrate the functionality of the circular linked list and will later be used to implement the 'death' mechanic as mentioned before once additional combat actions are set up.

The sorting algorithm for the circular linked list is very simple; using each character's swift ability score it places the highest value as the head of the list, and the head of the linked list's 'nextUp' property is set to the character node with the next highest swift ability score, and the process is repeated until the 'head' is reached again. For tie-breakers, the current implementation simply sets the character node first encountered during the sorting function ahead of the other characters with the same score. Future implementation will involve taking all of the character nodes with the same 'swift' score and assigning each of them a random integer between 1 and 20, then assigning them to the turnTracker in that order.

The additional data structure that was implemented was a map/associative array. This is a built-in feature of the game engine, but I used it to great effect for scene navigation from the WorldMap scene. I built a dictionary with key-value pairs, where the keys were simple scene titles and the values were the relevant scene file paths. This allowed me to compartmentalize the scene directory and keep it separate from the rest of the world map scripting while also letting me grab the path values with simple keys that were set into 2d Collision Shapes on my WorldMap. When the player icon collided with these collision shapes, a signal containing the key would be sent to the WorldMap script which would then translate the key to the value pair. Once translated, this path value would then be used to update a button, which upon being pressed, would execute a scene transition to that particular level. I am not sure if this is exactly worth mentioning since it was a built-in feature and I did not modify the data structure much from what we practiced in class conceptually. However, getting many different file paths set to work properly based on their keys, along with the signaling and file communication to do so, was very challenging and I consider what I learned extremely valuable, not only in terms of building a functional program, but also in terms of organizing a project and all of its subsequent parts.
